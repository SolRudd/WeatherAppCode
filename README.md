# Weather App
This is a weather application that displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for a chosen location.

I created this app using React and OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

In this app, the user can:

- Search for weather by city name or zip code
- Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units
- View current weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction
- View a 5-day forecast with daily temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather
### Technologies used:
